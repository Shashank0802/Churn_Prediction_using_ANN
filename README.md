# Churn_Prediction_using_ANN
This project employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn, leveraging Keras for building, training, and evaluating the model. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

# Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to understand and reduce customer attrition. This project builds an ANN model using Keras to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing customer data.


Model Development: Designing an ANN with layers for binary classification.

Model Training: Training the ANN on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics like accuracy and loss curves.

# Features

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data and encode categorical variables.

Normalize numerical features for better ANN training.

ANN Architecture:

Input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer for binary classification.

Use of activation functions such as ReLU and Sigmoid.

Optimization with the Adam optimizer.

Model Evaluation:

Calculate accuracy and loss.

Visualize training and validation metrics over epochs.
# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
